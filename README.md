# XREmu - A VRChat client emulator in Unity for SDK2 and SDK3
# Based on CyanEmu

CyanEmu is a VRChat client emulator that enables you to test your VRChat worlds directly in Unity! One of the biggest problems with debugging VRChat worlds is not knowing exactly what the issue is. With CyanEmu, you can look at the state of all objects to verify things directly. CyanEmu comes with a basic player controller, allowing you to explore your worlds and use pickups and interacts. Works with both SDK2/Triggers and SDK3/Udon.
